pyhealth.processors.AncestorRollupProcessor
===========================================

Overview
--------

Processor that rolls observed concept codes up to their retained ancestors in
a condition hierarchy and projects the successful paths into one
:class:`torch_geometric.data.Data` graph per sample. Registered as
``"ancestor_rollup"`` in the processor registry.

It implements the depth-limited roll-up of KEEP
(`Elhussein et al., CHIL 2025 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05049>`_, appendix
A.1.1 and A.4): ICD diagnoses are converted to standard OMOP concepts, the
concepts are rolled up to eligible SNOMED ancestors within a depth limit of
the "Disease" root, and the paths that explain each roll-up become a graph.
The behaviour was rehearsed and validated against a standalone reference
before this port; the OMOP integration is built on the vocabulary reader of
`PR #2 <https://github.com/rishabshah/PyHealth/pull/2>`_ —
:class:`~pyhealth.medcode.OMOPVocabulary`,
:class:`~pyhealth.medcode.ConditionHierarchy` and
:class:`~pyhealth.medcode.ICDToSNOMEDMapper` — which this processor reuses
without modification.

Two entry points build the same internal roll-up index:

- the generic constructor takes a :class:`~pyhealth.graph.KnowledgeGraph`
  whose ``hierarchy_relation`` triples are supplied **parent -> child**, a
  domain mapping, and optionally authoritative root depths and closure pairs;
- :meth:`~pyhealth.processors.AncestorRollupProcessor.from_omop` derives
  everything from an :class:`~pyhealth.medcode.OMOPVocabulary`: the uncut
  SNOMED condition subtree supplies the traversal edges and the
  ``CONCEPT_ANCESTOR`` minimum separations become the authoritative root
  depths.

Semantics
^^^^^^^^^

- **Depth cutoff.** ``max_depth`` (default 5, KEEP's setting) applies to
  *target eligibility* over the uncut hierarchy, not to hierarchy
  truncation: deep sources and intermediate concepts stay traversable, and
  the reader's own ``max_depth``/``restrict()`` remain separate knobs for
  graph-shaped consumers. The cutoff is computed before any truncation, and
  ``first_retained`` stopping is branch-local.
- **Target policies.** ``"first_retained"`` stops each upward branch at its
  first eligible ancestor; ``"all_retained"`` emits every distinct eligible
  strict ancestor. KEEP's actual choice is unresolved; the caller decides.
- **Failure reasons.** ``unknown_code``, ``outside_domain`` (non-Condition),
  ``unreachable`` (Condition concept outside the subtree), ``no_target``
  (reachable source with no eligible target on the selected edges); typed
  errors by default, empty results under ``on_unmapped="empty"``.
- **Path sources.** ``path_source="direct"`` uses the "Is a" edges;
  ``path_source="closure"`` additionally adds ``CONCEPT_ANCESTOR`` pairs at
  minimum separation one (direct provenance wins on overlap). Edges that
  exist only in the closure are flagged in the edge-aligned ``closure_only``
  mask of the projected graph. The selected edge set must be acyclic.
- **Occurrence counting.** :meth:`rollup_codes` returns one typed result per
  input occurrence, in input order; the projected graph merges nodes and
  edges. ICD conversion stays explicit through
  ``vocabulary.icd_mapper()``, so the caller keeps diagnosis event IDs and
  owns counting: converging targets within one event count once, distinct
  events stay distinct.

Synthetic example
-----------------

A deep source, the depth cutoff, both path modes, and a closure-only edge,
without any Athena download (closure pairs stand in for the
``CONCEPT_ANCESTOR`` rows):

.. code-block:: python

    from pyhealth.graph import KnowledgeGraph
    from pyhealth.processors import AncestorRollupProcessor

    # R is the root; A and B sit at depth 1, C at depth 2. M is a deep
    # concept whose only "Is a" parent was filtered out by the source
    # vocabulary, so it has no hierarchy edge at all (the "treats" row is
    # a canary that keeps M in the graph without making it a child of B).
    kg = KnowledgeGraph(triples=[
        ("R", "is_a", "A"), ("R", "is_a", "B"), ("A", "is_a", "C"),
        ("B", "treats", "M"),
    ])
    domains = {"R": "Condition", "A": "Condition", "B": "Condition",
               "C": "Condition", "M": "Condition"}

    # Authoritative root depths, e.g. OMOP CONCEPT_ANCESTOR separations:
    # M sits at depth 3 even though no "Is a" edge reaches it.
    root_depths = {"R": 0, "A": 1, "B": 1, "C": 2, "M": 3}

    base = dict(
        knowledge_graph=kg, domain_by_code=domains,
        hierarchy_relation="is_a", root="R",
        target_policy="first_retained", include_root=False,
        max_depth=2, on_unmapped="empty", root_depths=root_depths,
    )
    direct = AncestorRollupProcessor(**base)
    closure = AncestorRollupProcessor(
        path_source="closure", closure_pairs=[("A", "M")], **base
    )

    # With the cutoff at 2, C is retained (identity) while the deep M has
    # no eligible path on the direct edges alone:
    direct.rollup_codes(["C", "M"])
    # [RollupResult(source='C', targets=('C',), source_depth=2, reason='retained'),
    #  RollupResult(source='M', targets=(), source_depth=3, reason='no_target')]

    # The closure pair stitches M to its separation-one ancestor A:
    closure.rollup_codes(["M"])
    # [RollupResult(source='M', targets=('A',), source_depth=3, reason='rolled_up')]

    graph = closure.process(["M"])
    graph.node_ids       # tensor([0, 3])  -- global entity ids, here A and M
    graph.edge_index     # tensor([[0], [1]])  -- one edge, parent -> child
    graph.seed_mask      # tensor([False, True])  -- M was observed
    graph.target_mask    # tensor([True, False])  -- A is the target
    graph.closure_only   # tensor([True])  -- the edge exists only in the closure

    # Both modes keep the same authoritative depths; the fingerprint
    # records the configuration, the depth method and the edge provenance,
    # so task schemas distinguish them:
    direct.fingerprint == closure.fingerprint    # False

This is the synthetic shape of a real Athena discrepancy: some concepts have
a standard ancestor at ``CONCEPT_ANCESTOR`` separation one whose
``CONCEPT_RELATIONSHIP`` row is missing, because their only "Is a" route
runs through a valid-but-nonstandard intermediate that every filtered
hierarchy drops. On such concepts ``path_source="direct"`` reports
``no_target`` while ``path_source="closure"`` returns the target and flags
the stitched edge.

Rolling up ICD diagnoses
------------------------

ICD conversion is explicit: the mapper runs first, the processor consumes
OMOP ``concept_id`` strings, and the caller keeps the diagnosis event IDs.
One ICD code can map to several concepts; each concept occurrence gets its
own result, and converging targets within one event count once:

.. code-block:: python

    from pyhealth.medcode import OMOPVocabulary
    from pyhealth.processors import AncestorRollupProcessor

    vocabulary = OMOPVocabulary("~/data/athena")
    processor = AncestorRollupProcessor.from_omop(
        vocabulary, target_policy="first_retained",
        include_root=False, max_depth=5,
    )
    mapper = vocabulary.icd_mapper()

    # A patient's diagnosis events; the event id is yours to keep.
    events = [
        ("visit-1:dx-0", 10, "I21.4"),
        ("visit-1:dx-1", 10, "I25.10"),   # maps to two concepts
        ("visit-2:dx-0", 10, "I21.A1"),
    ]

    for event_id, version, icd_code in events:
        results = [
            processor.rollup_codes([str(concept_id)])[0]
            for concept_id in mapper.map(icd_code, version=version)
        ]
        # one result per concept occurrence, in mapping order
        targets = {target for result in results for target in result.targets}
        # converging targets within the event count once; distinct events
        # stay distinct, because counting belongs to the task
        print(event_id, [result.source for result in results], sorted(targets))

On the OMOP path, ``node_ids`` carries the integer OMOP ``concept_id`` of
each projected node, so ``str(node_id)`` decodes it without any lookup.
